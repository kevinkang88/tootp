#The Object Oriented Thought Process Book Notes

##Chapter 1

###Intro & fundamental concepts 

Thinking in terms of OOP is simple because we already think in this manner. When we look at a person you see person as an object then notice their attributes and behaviors. A person has attributes such as eye color, age, and height. Also, a person has behaviors such as walking, talking, and coding. 
In OOP attributes and behaviors are linked together while procedural programming looks at them separately.
Objects are more than data structures! They contain methods that are used to prform operations

###advantages 

Data and operations that manipulate the data are both encapsulated in the object. when object is transported across a network the entire object including the data and behavior goes with it

Another advantage of OO is encapsulation and data hiding. You only have to reveal interfaces that other objects must have to interact with (major part of encapsultion)

what is encapsulation? You already know

###abstraction

something we do/should do everyday that allows us to represent complex reality interms of simplified model
